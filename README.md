# Hackathon_SP16
***Chris Martin, Sara Gong, Andi Chen***

##Materials
- Arduino Uno or MKR1000 or Zero
- A breadboard
- A bunck of wires
- 2 (3?) servo motors
- A bunch of cardboard
- Might want some kind of internal frame to support lock movement (errector set?)

##Basic Functionality
###Put stuff in:
- User enters cubby number
- Cubby opens
- User puts food in cubby
- User closes cubby
- User enters code
- Machine rotates so an empty cubby is in the front

###Take stuff out:
- User enters cubby number
- Machine rotates so cubby is in the front
- User enters code
- Cubby opens
- Machine clears code
- User takes out food
- User closes cubby

##Ideas
- Can monitor if there are any empty cubbies online
- Has freezers
- Website option allows users to reserve a cubby
- Also allows one to track how long stuff has been in there and releases the code after a while
