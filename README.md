##Basic Functionality
###Put stuff in:
- User enters cubby number
- Cubby opens
- User puts food in cubby
- User closes cubby
- User enters code
- Machine rotates so an empty cubby is in the front

###Take stuff out:
- User enters cubby number
- Machine rotates so cubby is in the front
- User enters code
- Cubby opens
- Machine clears code
- User takes out food
- User closes cubby

##Ideas
- Can monitor if there are any empty cubbies online
- Has freezers
